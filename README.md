# My ArgoCD Project

This project demonstrates how to use ArgoCD for managing Kubernetes applications. It includes the necessary manifests to deploy applications and manage them effectively.

## Project Structure

```

├── manifests
│   ├── application.yaml         # Defines an ArgoCD Application resource
│   ├── app-of-apps.yaml         # Manages multiple applications in ArgoCD
│   └── base
│       ├── deployment.yaml      # Defines a Kubernetes Deployment resource
│       ├── service.yaml         # Defines a Kubernetes Service resource
│       └── kustomization.yaml    # Manages Kubernetes resources with Kustomize
├── README.md                    # Documentation for the project
└── .gitignore                   # Specifies files to ignore by Git
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install ArgoCD**
   Follow the official ArgoCD installation guide to set up ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Deploy the Applications**
   Use the provided manifests to deploy your applications. You can apply the manifests using:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f manifests/
   ```

4. **Access the ArgoCD UI**
   After deploying, access the ArgoCD UI to manage your applications. You can log in using the default admin credentials.

## Usage Guidelines

- Modify the `application.yaml` and `app-of-apps.yaml` files to suit your application's needs.
- Update the `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` files in the `base` directory to configure your application deployment and service settings.
- Use `kustomization.yaml` to manage overlays and transformations for different environments.
